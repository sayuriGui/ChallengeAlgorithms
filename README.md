## Challenges
- [Challenge 1: ](https://github.com/sayuri-gui/ChallengeAlgorithms/blob/main/challenge1.cpp) This is a C++ program that takes two points in the format (x, y) and returns a list of approximated points representing a line segment
- [Challenge 2: ](https://github.com/sayuri-gui/ChallengeAlgorithms/blob/main/challenge2.py) This Python program uses Processing Python to take two points in the format (x, y) and returns a list of approximated points representing a line segment, based on the next given test cases.
    1. (1,2),  (100,20)
    2. (10,200), (50,10)
    3. (300,300), (10,10)
    4. (200,300), (250,50)
    5. (350,350), (100, 300)
- [Challenge 3: ](https://github.com/sayuri-gui/ChallengeAlgorithms/tree/main/challenge3) 
This program uses OpenGL that takes two points in the format (x, y) and returns a list of approximated points representing a line segment.
- [Challenge 4: ](https://github.com/sayuri-gui/ChallengeAlgorithms/tree/main/Challenge4) 
This OpenGL program, along with two complementary codes, allows the user to draw a filled pentagon with a random color. Each left-button mouse click increases the number of sides by one and changes the fill color. The program will reset to a pentagon once the maximum number of sides (12) is reached
- [Challenge 5: ](https://github.com/sayuri-gui/ChallengeAlgorithms/tree/main/Challenge5) 
This OpenGL program implement the transformations of translation, rotation, and scaling.
- [Challenge 6: ](https://github.com/sayuri-gui/ChallengeAlgorithms/tree/main/Challenge6) This Processing program is a curve drawing application that allows the user to draw lines with the mouse, set control points, and manipulate these points with the mouse to create and modify curves using p5.js curve functions.
- [Challenge 7: ](https://github.com/sayuri-gui/ChallengeAlgorithms/tree/main/Challenge7)This Processing program creates an animation featuring a bouncing ball that incorporates concepts such as gravity, refresh rate, object deformation, timing, real-time animation, curve drawing algorithms, color, and texture.
