# Challenge 6

## Description
Processing program is a curve drawing application that allows the user to draw lines with the mouse, set control points, and manipulate these points with the mouse to create and modify curves using p5.js curve functions.

## Instructions
In Processing, create a curve drawing application with the following expects:

- First, draw a line with the mouse.
    - Click and while you're pressing the mouse the line is growing or decreasing.
    - Once the mouse click is released, the line is finished in the last mouse cursor position
- Second, define (with mouse clicks) your control points (draw them)
    - Once your control points are defined, remove the previous created line and draw the curve that is defined by your control points
    - You can use any supported curve functions in Processing
- Third, add the capability of moving your control points (with the mouse)
