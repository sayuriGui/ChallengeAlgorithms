# Challenge 4

## Description
This OpenGL program, along with two complementary codes, allows the user to draw a filled pentagon with a random color. Each left-button mouse click increases the number of sides by one and changes the fill color. The program will reset to a pentagon once the maximum number of sides (12) is reached
